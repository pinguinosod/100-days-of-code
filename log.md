# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a VueJS project in which I will be making some simple applications in order to test things, or simply practice. I've started this project for a couple days before, but let's call this day 1. Today I implemented font-awesome as some other visual improvements, I've uploaded the code to github, and deployed the project to a web hosting.

**Thoughts**: Finding the right icon to the right action takes time.

### Day 2: June 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I played a lot with transition effects, added transition to router-view in Content component, the transition which is applied is dynamic depending if its going back to root or not.

**Thoughts**: Choosing the right animation takes time.
I am thinking in creating a breadcrumbs component and replace the back button on the apps.
Github is warning about a security vulnerability in package-lock.json, I have to check it out.

### Day 3: June 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a vuejs app in which the user has to type the same characters of a random generated string as fast as possible.


### Day 4: June 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the random string app that I started yesterday, I'm calling it Fastype. I wrote some tests for it using Jest.

**Thoughts**: I'm new to tests, but I'm already liking this tests thing. I'm thinking on giving test driven development a try.


### Day 5: June 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Fastype, made it friendlier to mobile, had to change the keypress event to input event, re-wrote some tests, and pushed it to github.

**Thoughts**: I should try mobile first approach.
