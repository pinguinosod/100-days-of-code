# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on a VueJS project in which I will be making some simple applications in order to test things, or simply practice. I've started this project for a couple days before, but let's call this day 1. Today I implemented font-awesome as some other visual improvements, I've uploaded the code to github, and deployed the project to a web hosting.

**Thoughts** Finding the right icon to the right action takes time.

### Day 2: June 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I played a lot with transition effects, added transition to router-view in Content component, the transition which is applied is dynamic depending if its going back to root or not.

**Thoughts** Choosing the right animation takes time.
I am thinking in creating a breadcrumbs component and replace the back button on the apps.
Github is warning about a security vulnerability in package-lock.json, I have to check it out.
